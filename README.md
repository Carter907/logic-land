# Logic Land

This website is a comprehensive expoloration of all kinds of logical thinking. I wanted to create this no only for my own notes and curiousity, but for others so that the world becomes more logically adept. A lot of my thought around logic may not be correct, but I hope they can at least guide you to your own thinking and reflection around the fascinating field of logic. 

This project is really a beginners guide, and hopefully as time goes on, I will write about more complex topics in logic. My goal is to distil the important parts of logic and how they connect with everyday english and speech, making my notes very practical.

## Usage of LLMs

I try to keep the usage of LLMs to a minimal as the goal for this project is to distil logical subjects I've learned about from my discrete structures course as well as personal readings. I don't want to dilute throug the use of some language model. I may use AI when trying to construct tedious visuals such as tables, but this usage won't effect the content itself.
