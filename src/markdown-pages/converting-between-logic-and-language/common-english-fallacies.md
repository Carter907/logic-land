## Common English Fallacies

There are many different types of fallacies that are used on a daily based when it comes to argumentation. People employ these fallacies because they seem like they are presenting some argument; however, as you know, for an argument to be valid, specific criteria must be met.

Some of the most popular fallacies are the converse error or *affirming the consequent* and the inverse error or *denying the antecedent*.
Both of these fallacies come from a misunderstanding of the conditional for a bi-conditional which makes sense once you understand the inference rules for each.
