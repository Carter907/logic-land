## Conditional

Let think of what the statement "if this, then that" truly means. When we talk about conditions, we are defining a relationship between two statements where if the 1st is the true, then the 2nd must be true as well. If this requirement is satisfied then the conditional is true. if not, then it is false.

Here is a solid example of the conditional in action that I think you're appreciate as you learn more. 

>If a and b negate each other, then a and b have different truth values.

This is a true conditional in logic. When any two statement negate each other, then they always have differing truth values. 

For instance, the statement *The sky is blue* is negated by the statement *The sky is not blue*.

**Just Because Statements**

Whenever you work with conditionals, you'll realize that people sometimes fall into a trap. You might think that the 1st statement being true entails the truth of the 2nd that the converse behaves the same way.

is...\
$\text{If it is raining outside, then I will wear a raincoat.}$

the same as...\
$\text{If I will wear a raincoat, then it is raining outside.}$

Assuming the propositions are simply switched around, the answer is no, these are two entirely different statements.

*Just because* statements are used to defend this quality of conditionals. If we claim the 1st statement, "If it is raining outside, then I will wear a raincoat", and someone says "Why are you wearing a raincoat if it's not raining", then you respond with a *just because*:

>Just because I am wearing a raincoat doesn't mean It is raining outside. However, if it were raining outside, I would surely be wearing a raincoat.

The error described above is known as *affirming the consequent*. You're affirming that because the consequent (2nd statement) is true, the antecedent (1st statement) is also true.

**Back to our previous example**

>If a and b negate each other, then a and b have different truth values.

What would be the result of equating this statement with its converse:

>if a and b have different truth values, then a and b negate each other.

Lets suppose the 2nd statement is true, and that $a$ is "I walked my dog around the park". The negation of this statement is obviously, "I didn't walk my dog around the park". However, to satisfy the conditional, all we have to do is pick two statements that have different truth values...

$a$ - $\text{ I walked my dog around the park.}$\
$b$ - $\text{ Bananas are red.}$

So if we were to say $a$ is true and $b$ is false, then that must mean (by the definition of the conditional) that they must negate each other, but they don't!
