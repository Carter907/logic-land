## Predicates

predicates are functions that take in values and output a truth value depending on if the sentence becomes true or not.

For instance...

$$P(x) = x\ is\ blue$$
$$P(banana) = false$$
$$P(jeans) = true$$
Predicates are like conditional tests that evaluate to true or false depending on the domain.

**How are they related to Quantifiers?**

Quantifiers are often used with predicates because they can test the truth value of many different elements in a set.

predicates are like generic sentences that take in a value or multiple values depending on the size of the set.
